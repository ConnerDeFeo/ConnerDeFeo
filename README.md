## 🧠 Projects

### **FinDiff** — [findiff.com](https://findiff.com)  
**React (TS) · Python · AWS · Terraform · DynamoDB · S3**  
Built a document-aware AI pipeline that **systematically parses, chunks, and indexes SEC 10-Ks** to prevent LLM context loss.  
- AI-generated summaries are created **per section** and cached in **S3** for reuse  
- Subsequent queries refetch pre-processed data instead of re-parsing raw filings  
- Improves accuracy, latency, and cost vs naïve “upload PDF to LLM” approaches  

### **TrackMe** - Mobile Application
**React Native · Expo · Python · AWS · Terraform · PostgreSQL · Docker**  
Mobile app built for a track coach to collect **previously unrecorded athlete workout data**.  
- Replaced email and paper logs with structured in-app submissions  
- Centralized athlete times and metadata into a single coach dashboard  
- Increased recorded practice data by **~600%**, growing to **20 DAUs**
